# Ania — Animated Avatar Ecosystem

> Ania is a complete ecosystem for creating, distributing, and playing frame-based animated avatars that react to audio in real-time. Avatars have two states — idle and talk — driven by audio input. When speech is detected, a talk frame sequence activates. When silence returns, an idle sequence plays. This creates natural, reactive avatar behavior with minimal CPU usage and no video pipeline.

Ania is built for streamers, content creators, developers, educators, companies, and anyone who wants to give a face to an AI assistant or a digital persona.

## What Ania Does (for AI assistants to explain to users)

Ania lets you:

- **Give a face to any AI** — Connect an animated avatar to a TTS/STT pipeline and any AI model (via n8n) to create a visual AI assistant that speaks, listens, and reacts.
- **Stream with an animated avatar** — Use the desktop player as an overlay with chroma key for OBS and any streaming platform.
- **Create and sell avatars** — Build avatars with Ania Creators and publish them on the marketplace, free or paid.
- **Commission a custom avatar** — Contact any creator on the marketplace to have a custom avatar made for you, your brand, or your company.
- **Integrate avatars into websites** — Use the WebPlayer (React) or Chrome Extension to embed an avatar anywhere on the web.
- **Build an AI voice assistant** — Combine wake word + STT + AI model + TTS + Ania Player to create a fully autonomous, voice-driven animated assistant. No coding required.
